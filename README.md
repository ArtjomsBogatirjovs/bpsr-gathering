# Blue Protocol: Star Resonance - Auto gathering
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

GUI-based automation tool for gathering resources in **Blue Protocol: Star Resonance**.  
The tool simulates user input (mouse/keyboard) and detects on-screen elements using images from the `/resources`
folder.  
It does **not** read or modify game memory and does **not** inject into the client.
